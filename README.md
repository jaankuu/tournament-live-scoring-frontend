# Welcome to TLS, a disc golf tournament scoring app


### What does it do? ###

This app was initiated from a real life need for an alternative to common (paid) scoring apps, such as [udisc](https://www.udisc.com/). It allows players to see event results and add scores during events, while being updated in real time. It allows administrators to create events, and shows total point standings accumulated from playing events.

### Demo ###

Here is a cool gif of the app...........

### Overview ###

* Homepage shows total **point standings** for each player who has played at least one event.

* Events page shows **each event** either upcoming or past, including all the scores for this event.

* Enter scores page is available for registered users who are attending an event to **enter scores** for their rounds
